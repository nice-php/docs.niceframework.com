# Codex
**Codex** is a simple file-based Markdown documentation platform built on top of Laravel. It's completely customizable and dead simple to use to create beautiful documentation.

## Completely Open Source
I built Codex to be open and available to *everyone*. Documentation is incredibly important that can make or break even the best development projects. This is why the code powering Codex is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/caffeinated/codex) under the [MIT license](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license).

In short, I want to see beautiful documentation being written everywhere! No excuses!
